This is based on the React comment box example from [the React tutorial](http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/tutorial.html).

**For learning purposes.** Using a rather minimal set up and first attempt at ES2015 syntax.

## To test

```sh
npm install
npm run build
node server.js
```
And visit <http://localhost:3000/>.
